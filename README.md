OpenProfile is an upcoming collaborative cross-platform application for writers, producers, and role-players to share minds and create diverse characters using an immensely advanced and FREE character profile template. For fandoms and authors, we even have a public database in the works that would enable users to learn more about your characters and the universe that goes around them!
